tcpsock:sslhandshake
--------------------
**语法:** *session, err = tcpsock:sslhandshake(reused_session?, server_name?, ssl_verify?)*

**内容:** *rewrite_by_lua*, access_by_lua*, content_by_lua*, ngx.timer.**

对当前建立的连接上完成 SSL/TLS 握手。
Does SSL/TLS handshake on the currently established connection.

The optional `reused_session` argument can take a former SSL
session userdata returned by a previous `sslhandshake`
call for exactly the same target. For short-lived connections, reusing SSL
sessions can usually speed up the handshake by one order by magnitude but it
is not so useful if the connection pool is enabled. This argument defaults to
`nil`. If this argument takes the boolean `false` value, no SSL session
userdata would return by this call and only a Lua boolean will be returned as
the first return value; otherwise the current SSL session will
always be returned as the first argument in case of successes.

The optional `server_name` argument is used to specify the server
name for the new TLS extension Server Name Indication (SNI). Use of SNI can
make different servers share the same IP address on the server side. Also,
when SSL verification is enabled, this `server_name` argument is
also used to validate the server name specified in the server certificate sent from
the remote.

The optional `ssl_verify` argument takes a Lua boolean value to
control whether to perform SSL verification. When set to `true`, the server
certificate will be verified according to the CA certificates specified by
the [lua_ssl_trusted_certificate](#lua_ssl_trusted_certificate) directive.
You may also need to adjust the [lua_ssl_verify_depth](#lua_ssl_verify_depth)
directive to control how deep we should follow along the certificate chain.
Also, when the `ssl_verify` argument is true and the
`server_name` argument is also specified, the latter will be used
to validate the server name in the server certificate.

The optional `send_status_req` argument takes a boolean that controls whether to send
the OCSP status request in the SSL handshake request (which is for requesting OCSP stapling).

<!-- todo 这三个章节，搞不定。主要是完全没用过 -->

对已经完成 SSL/TLS 握手的连接，该方法立即返回。
For connections that have already done SSL/TLS handshake, this method returns
immediately.

该特性在 `v0.9.11` 版本首次引入。
This method was first introduced in the `v0.9.11` release.
